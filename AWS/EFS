☁️ AWS EFS (Elastic File System) – Notes
1️⃣ EFS

Amazon EFS is a fully managed, scalable file storage service for EC2.
It provides a shared file system that multiple instances can access at the same time.

2️⃣ File System Type

EFS uses the NFS (Network File System) protocol.
It is commonly used for Linux-based workloads that need shared access.

3️⃣ Scalability

EFS automatically scales storage up and down as files are added or removed.
There is no need to manually provision storage size.

4️⃣ Performance Modes

EFS offers different performance modes like General Purpose and Max I/O.
These modes help optimize latency or throughput based on application needs.

5️⃣ Throughput Modes

EFS provides Bursting Throughput and Provisioned Throughput.
This controls how fast data can be read or written.

6️⃣ Availability & Durability

EFS stores data across multiple Availability Zones.
This ensures high availability and durability of data.

7️⃣ Security

EFS supports encryption at rest and in transit.
Access is controlled using security groups and IAM policies.

8️⃣ Access Points

EFS Access Points simplify access management for applications.
They provide application-specific entry points with defined permissions.

9️⃣ Use Cases

EFS is used for shared web servers, content management systems, and home directories.
It is ideal when multiple EC2 instances need the same data.

🔟 EFS vs EBS (Quick Idea)

EFS is shared and scalable file storage, while EBS is attached to a single EC2.
EFS supports multiple EC2 instances at the same time.
