AWS Lambda – Notes
1️⃣ Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service.
It lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

2️⃣ Event-Driven

Lambda runs code only when an event occurs.
Events can come from S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, or CloudWatch.

3️⃣ Supported Languages

Lambda supports languages like Python, Node.js, Java, Go, and .NET.
You can choose the language based on your application.

4️⃣ Automatic Scaling

Lambda automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests.
No manual scaling is required.

5️⃣ Pricing

You pay only for execution time and number of requests.
There is no charge when the code is not running.

6️⃣ Execution Environment

Lambda runs code in a short-lived execution environment.
It has limited memory, storage, and execution time.

7️⃣ Security

Lambda uses IAM roles to control permissions.
It can run inside a VPC for network isolation.

8️⃣ Monitoring

Lambda integrates with CloudWatch for logs and metrics.
You can monitor errors, duration, and invocations.

9️⃣ Integration

Lambda integrates with many AWS services like S3, API Gateway, SNS, and DynamoDB.
It is commonly used in serverless architectures.

🔟 Use Cases

Lambda is used for file processing, APIs, automation, and real-time data processing.
It is ideal for short-running tasks
