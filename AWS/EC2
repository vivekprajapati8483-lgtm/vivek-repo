AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Notes
1️⃣ EC2

Amazon EC2 provides virtual servers in the cloud called instances.
It allows users to run applications without buying physical hardware.

2️⃣ Instance Types

Instance types define CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
Examples include General Purpose, Compute Optimized, and Memory Optimized.

3️⃣ AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

An AMI is a template used to launch EC2 instances.
It includes the operating system, software, and configuration settings.

4️⃣ Instance Purchasing Options

AWS offers different ways to pay for EC2 instances.
These include On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, Spot Instances, and Dedicated Hosts.

5️⃣ Key Pair

A key pair is used to securely connect to an EC2 instance.
It consists of a public key stored in AWS and a private key downloaded by the user.

6️⃣ Security Group

A security group acts as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances.
It controls inbound and outbound traffic and is stateful.

7️⃣ Elastic IP

An Elastic IP is a static public IP address for EC2.
It allows consistent access even if the instance is stopped or restarted.

8️⃣ Storage (EBS & Instance Store)

EBS provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances.
Instance Store offers temporary storage that is lost when the instance stops.

9️⃣ Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based on demand.
It helps maintain performance and reduces costs.

🔟 Load Balancer

A Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
It improves application availability and fault tolerance.
