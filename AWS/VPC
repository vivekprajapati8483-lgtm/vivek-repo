☁️ AWS Instance Purchasing Options (Step by Step)

Step 1: To run an EC2 instance in AWS, you first choose how you want to pay.

Step 2: On-Demand lets you pay only for the compute time you use, with no long-term commitment.

Step 3: Reserved Instances require a 1 or 3 year commitment and provide lower pricing.

Step 4: Savings Plans offer discounts when you commit to a consistent amount of usage, with more flexibility.

Step 5: Spot Instances use unused AWS capacity at a very low cost, but AWS can stop them anytime.

Step 6: Dedicated Hosts provide a physical server dedicated to one customer, mainly for compliance or licensing

☁️ AWS VPC – Point-wise Explanation
1️⃣ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

A VPC is a logically isolated virtual network in AWS.
It allows you to launch resources in a secure and controlled environment using your own IP range.

2️⃣ Subnet

A subnet is a smaller network inside a VPC.
It helps organize resources and can be public (internet access) or private (no direct internet access).

3️⃣ Internet Gateway (IGW)

An Internet Gateway allows communication between a VPC and the internet.
It is required for resources in a public subnet to be accessible from the internet.

4️⃣ Route Table

A route table controls how traffic is routed inside the VPC.
It defines where network traffic should go, such as to the internet gateway or NAT gateway.

5️⃣ NAT Gateway

A NAT Gateway allows instances in a private subnet to access the internet.
It prevents the internet from initiating connections to private instances.

6️⃣ Security Group

A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances.
It controls inbound and outbound traffic and is stateful in nature.

7️⃣ Network ACL (NACL)

A Network ACL is a firewall that works at the subnet level.
It controls traffic rules and is stateless, meaning rules must be defined for both directions.

8️⃣ Elastic IP (EIP)

An Elastic IP is a static public IP address provided by AWS.
It is used when a fixed IP is required for internet-facing resources.

9️⃣ Public Subnet

A public subnet is connected to the internet using an Internet Gateway.
Instances in this subnet can send and receive traffic from the internet.

🔟 Private Subnet

A private subnet does not have direct internet access.
Instances can access the internet only through a NAT Gateway for outbound traffic..
