AWS IAM – Notes
1️⃣ IAM

AWS IAM is a service used to manage users, access, and permissions in AWS.
It helps control who can access which AWS resources and what actions they can perform.

2️⃣ IAM Users

An IAM user represents a person or application that needs access to AWS.
Each user can have unique credentials like username, password, and access keys.

3️⃣ IAM Groups

IAM groups are collections of users with similar permissions.
Permissions are assigned to the group instead of individual users.

4️⃣ IAM Roles

IAM roles provide temporary access to AWS resources.
They are commonly used by EC2, Lambda, and cross-account access.

5️⃣ IAM Policies

IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions.
They specify what actions are allowed or denied on which resources.

6️⃣ Permissions

Permissions define what a user or role can do in AWS.
They follow the principle of least privilege.

7️⃣ Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication verifies who you are.
Authorization decides what you are allowed to do.

8️⃣ Access Keys

Access keys are used for programmatic access to AWS.
They consist of an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key.

9️⃣ MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

MFA adds an extra layer of security.
It requires a second verification step along with the password.

🔟 IAM Security Best Practices

Avoid using the root account for daily tasks.
Use IAM roles, enable MFA, and apply least-privilege policies.
