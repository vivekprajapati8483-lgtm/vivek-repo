🐳 Docker – Notes
1️⃣ Docker

Docker is a containerization platform used to build, ship, and run applications.
It packages the application and its dependencies into a container.

2️⃣ Container

A container is a lightweight, portable runtime environment.
It runs applications consistently across different systems.

3️⃣ Docker Image

A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers.
It contains application code, libraries, and dependencies.

4️⃣ Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions to build an image.
It defines how the image should be created step by step.

5️⃣ Docker Engine

Docker Engine is the core service that runs Docker containers.
It includes the Docker daemon and CLI.

6️⃣ Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a public image registry.
Users can pull ready-made images or push their own images.

7️⃣ Volumes

Docker volumes are used for persistent data storage.
They allow data to survive even after a container is deleted.

8️⃣ Docker Network

Docker networking enables communication between containers.
It supports bridge, host, and overlay networks.

9️⃣ Docker Compose

Docker Compose is used to run multi-container applications.
It uses a YAML file to define services.

🔟 Docker vs Virtual Machine

Docker containers share the host OS, making them lightweight.
Virtual machines include a full OS and are heavier.
